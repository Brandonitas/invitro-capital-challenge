# Healthcare Appointment Booking UI Challenge

## Objective

Design and build a fully responsive and accessible appointment booking UI for a healthcare platform. This task focuses purely on front-end implementation — layout, interaction, accessibility, and code quality.

You're allowed to use AI tools or platforms to accelerate the delivery of your task.

## Your Task

### 1. Doctor Directory View

- Mock list of doctors (name, photo, specialty, availability, location)
- Filter by specialty and availability
- "Book Appointment" button on each card

### 2. Booking Modal

- Opens when a user clicks "Book Appointment"
- Shows doctor name + available time slots (mocked)
- Allows user to select time slot and click "Confirm"

### 3. Appointments Summary View

- Section/tab where users can view their booked appointments
- Show doctor name, date/time, specialty, and location

## Key Requirements

### Tech Stack

- React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS (TypeScript optional)
- Styling: TailwindCSS or plain CSS (whichever you're more comfortable with)
- State: Local state or lightweight solution like Zustand
- No backend needed — mock data and basic flow only
